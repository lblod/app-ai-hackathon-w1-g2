## Data Extraction Utilities & RDF Ontology Transformation 

## Description

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks designed for downloading data from specific URLs, extracting information from PDFs and RDF ontology transformation (SPARQL compatible). The notebooks are focused on transforming, extracting, and managing data and working with metadata and PDFs. Each notebook covers a distinct functionality essential for developers working with unstructured data and structured metadata.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **RDF Ontology Transformation (SPARQL compatible).ipynb**
   - This notebook handles RDF (Resource Description Framework) ontology transformation and ensures compatibility with SPARQL queries.
   - You can use this notebook to transform and manipulate RDF data effectively for use in linked data projects, semantic web applications, and knowledge graph development.

2. **Download directly from aanduidingsobject_url.ipynb**
   - This notebook allows for the direct download of data from specified URLs.
   - Ideal for scraping data from online sources or for bulk data downloading.

3. **ABB_Extraction of PDFs and Metadata.ipynb**
   - This notebook is built to extract content from PDFs, as well as retrieve and manage metadata related to those PDFs.
   - Useful for developers working with document processing, especially for extracting structured information from unstructured PDFs.
